- **Tools Used**:
  - PostgreSQL  
  - Advanced SQL (Joins, CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregations)  
- **Key skills demonstrated**:  
  Business-oriented querying • Insight generation • Risk identification • Actionable recommendation writing

## Key Business Questions & Insights (Top 20 Highlights)

1. **Total Revenue by Category**  
   Beverages → **24.55%** of total revenue (dominant)  
   → High concentration risk → Protect supply chain + promote diversification

2. **Top 5 Customers by Total Spend**

3. **Payment Method Popularity**  
   Card dominates revenue & shows higher ATV  
   → Secure digital infrastructure + negotiate lower fees

4. **Sales by District**  
   Dhaka → **~22.39%** of total revenue (3× second place)  
   → Extreme geographic dependency → Protect Dhaka + expand to Chittagong etc.
